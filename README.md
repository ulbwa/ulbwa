# Projects
My main programming language is Python. I usually do Backend development and Telegram bots. Here is a list of projects that are significant to me.

## MockupEngineer
Simple and easy to use device layout generator. Supports over 15 different models ranging from phones to wearables. Written in the Python programming language and does not have a graphical interface, however, it can be easily embedded into any resource, be it a website or a Telegram bot.

## LosslessRobot
Free Telegram bot for downloading music in lossless and lossy codecs. The music is provided by Tidal under a Tidal Hi-Fi Plus subscription, metadata and search engine - Deezer. The project has been developing since 2020 and is actively gathering an audience, thereby bringing commercial orders and [donations](https://ulbwa.github.io/go?to=donate).

## Four One
Educational project of [Anastasia Sergeevna](https://www.instagram.com/nastelvegeco/) in the form of a Telegram bot. It is a text game with an adventure storyline. This project was created by a small team consisting of two programmers, a screenwriter and an artist, where I participated as one of the developers. At the moment, the development of the bot is suspended.
